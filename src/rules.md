<Rule rule="1.1">Griefing any player's work without their consent, even if it is unclaimed, is not allowed.</Rule>
<Rule rule="1.2">Leave chests, computers and other valuables as you found them, unless you know they're naturally generated.</Rule>
<Rule rule="1.3">Huge quarries, general purging of land/biomes etc. near spawn and other cities is unsightly and not allowed, but it is fine if it is far away from a city.</Rule>
<Rule rule="1.4">Branding the world with anything that could be considered breaking another rule (e.g. abuse towards other players, profanity, swastikas) is not allowed. Staff may remove these without warning, and/or punish the player(s) involved.</Rule>
<Rule rule="1.5">Sending disruptive messages via modem or rednet (e.g. spamming rednet, "spoofing" GPS) is not allowed.</Rule>

<h3 id="r2"><a class="rule-ref" href="#r2">§2</a> Do not attempt to crash the server or use excessive resources with 
malicious intent:</h3>

<Rule rule="2.1">Abusing any bugs, creating large laggy contraptions/farms (including mob farms), and writing bad programs that cause lag are all considered excessive use of server resources.</Rule>
<Rule rule="2.2">Staff might modify your programs to make them less laggy, and/or contact you about them.</Rule>

<Rule rule="2.4">Don't build massive mob farms, or active mob farms of any kind (aggro farms).</Rule>

</div>

<h1 id="evasion"><a class="rule-ref" href="#evasion">Evasion</a></h1>
Attempting to evade a previous punishment may result in extension or escalation of the punishment. A mute may be 
extended, or could be turned into a temporary ban.

- Admins and moderators interpret the rules. You cannot argue about special cases.
- Evading a chat mute in-game (e.g. with another account, by proxy of another player, via chatboxes, chatbox commands,
  regular commands) can result in extension of the mute, or escalation to a tempban.
- Evading a Discord mute (e.g. with another account, or by proxy of another player) can result in extension of the mute,
  or escalation to a tempban.
- Evading a ban, in-game and/or in Discord, by creating/using alt accounts can result in a permanent ban on all
  associated accounts.
- Harassing other players or staff regarding the reasoning for a mute or ban, or arguing with the terms of the mute or
  ban, can result in extension of the mute or ban, even permanently.

<h1 id="alts"><a class="rule-ref" href="#alts">Alt accounts</a></h1>

- Players are allowed up to **2 accounts**, that is one main account and one alt account.
- Players are allowed to AFK (e.g. for farms) with an alt account. ~~You **must** connect with the IP `afk.sc3.io`
  in this scenario.~~ (*Note:* This is currently not implemented.)
- Using alt accounts to evade any punishment is forbidden and can result in a permanent ban on all associated accounts.
- Using alt accounts to evade inter-player mutes (`/ignore`) is also not allowed.
- Alt accounts **must** donate 100% of their Krist income from the server (starting balance, daily login bonus, faucet 
  rewards) back to the server (`/welfare opt out` and then `/welfare return`). Not doing so is considered theft.
- Bot accounts are no longer allowed on the server. Automated activity falls under Rule 3.4 and is not allowed.
